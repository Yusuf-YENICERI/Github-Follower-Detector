## ðŸš€ Why should i use this?

It helps you to detect who follows you. The following one might be a user you are following or someone else following. So it works for any user.


## :exclamation: Requirements

This is an extension developed for Firefox. So you need a Firefox browser.


## :video_game: Usage

It is very easy to use this extension, but currently it is not published to Firefox Add-Ons.

## :exclamation: Warning

This extension needs GitHub Personal Token to be able to work with GitHub API. This project does not makes use of that Personal Token ever other than accessing Github API!
<br/>
<br/>
You can check the source code to be sure about it. The token is stored on local storage of your browser. I don't know if other extensions can access there or not. So take your own risk while using it!
